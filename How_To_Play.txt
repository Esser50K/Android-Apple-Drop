ANDROID APPLE DROP

This is a game about an Android collecting apples.

A -> Move left
D -> Move right

The objective of the game is catch the apples as they fall, gaining score.

If you miss an apple, then they will detroy the tile it lands on. If an apple gets below a tile, you lose a life.

It is game over when you run out of lives.

There a different apple types, some have different effects when collected:

RED     -> Red apples are regular apples, they do nothing special.
GREEN   -> Green apples will repair all broken tiles
YELLOW  -> Rare, yellow apples will give you an extra life.

You can also "shoot" the apples you collect.

To do this, click the mouse in a place. This will cause you lose a point, but it will fire an apple.

When these apple projectiles hit other apples, they destroy them, but they do not get collected!

Good luck...
